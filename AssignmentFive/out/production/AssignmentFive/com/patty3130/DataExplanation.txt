I am changing the format of the incoming data.
- If a family member has children, those children will be placed on the
  line immediately below. Similarly if the children have children their
  children will be placed on the line immediately below.

- For example, the example in the assignment text changes to:

Jones,3     (Jones is the root, this is the same, root = first line. Jones sons are below)
Bob,2       (Bob is one of Jones' sons)
Richard,0   (Since Bob has 2 sons they are immediately below - Richard = son 1 of Bob)
Jake,1      (Jake son 2 of Bob)
Bill,0      (Bill is son 1 of Jake - Jake's only son)
Dan,0       (Dan is son of Jones)
Brian,1     (Brian is son of Jones)
Michael,1   (Michael is son of Brian)
DeVille,0   (DeVille is son of Michael)
